I am a native of the Nilgiris, with very deep roots over several generations. At the turn of the centuary, I got into the corporate world in the Telecom Industry, travelling across cities, performing roles covering Customer Service, Retention and Relationship management. After more than 15 years of a very successful career, I had seen enough, was missing home and was desperate to put my energy into something I that was passionate about and worthy. Contributing my bit to making the worlk a better place. So after 15 years, I quit the rate race and went back to my roots. The Jade Shola is one of these initiatives where I want to share with you the beauty of the Nilgiris and the joy of restoring at least a small pportion of it to its native glory.
